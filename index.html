        <b>Primary objectives: </b>
        <a href="https://www.comicconindia.com/all-cities-main-page/bengaluru">
          Comic Con Bengaluru </a
        >is known to generate mighty buzz, and attracts a diverse crowd of anime
        enthusiasts from a broad demographic. Keeping in mind the event’s reach
        and popularity among specific interest groups, we outlined the following
        main objectives:
      </p>
      <li>
        <b>Brand visibility: </b> Reshape the brand’s identity in context and
        among newer audiences, amplifying its reach.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Quality engagement: </b>
        Create an immersive experience that captures the essence of Comic Con
        attendance and prolongs the dwell time at the booth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Digital traction: </b> Encourage attendees to share glimpses of their
        time well-spent on social media.
      </li>
      <p>
        <b>Event panning and storyboarding: </b> The client wanted to prioritize
        maintaining the ambiance of the festival in general, while adding the
        brand’s unique flavour at the booth. Keeping with the high spirits of
        fun an aesthetic innovation of Comic Con, we decided to install an
        <a href="https://www.gokapture.com/anti-gravity-photo-booth"
          >Anti Gravity Photo Booth
        </a>
        in Bangalore that would be an absolute visual treat to every passerby.
        Instead of cluttering the space with props, we decide to play up with
        colours that would pop off against both the venue’s thematic colour
        scheme and the brand’s signature hues. The vibrant, checkered room we
        thus created was meant to boldly stand out as an indulgent haven of a
        person who adored anime and movies. Collage: <br />
